			     OR1KSIM MAINTAINERS
			     ===================

This file contains information about people who are permitted to make changes
to various parts of the compiler and associated libraries.

Please do not contact the people in this file directly to report problems in
Or1ksim. 

For general information about Or1ksim, post to both OpenRISC mailing lists:

  openrisc@lists.openrisc.net
  openrisc@lists.opencores.org

(yes we do mean crosspost - they have disjoint sets of readers).

To report problems with Or1ksim, please visit:

  http://bugzilla.opencores.org/


Patch submission process
========================

The following process applies to both the SVN HEAD and release branches.

* Submit the patch to both OpenRISC mailing lists a diff against current SVN
  HEAD.
  - make sure you put the patch inline.

* Deal with any review comments.
 
* when the patch is approved (by any maintainer), anyone with
  write-after-approval permission to the SVN repository may commit the patch.

Note in particular a patch will not be accepted if the resulting code does not
pass "make distcheck".

Committing to private branches by the owner of that private branch needs no
approval process. Merge of that private branch into either SVN HEAD or a
release branch should follow the patch submission process above.
